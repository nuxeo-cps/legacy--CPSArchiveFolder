CPSArchiveFolder is an object that makes available the content of an archive
(currently ZIP, TGZ might be supported one day in the future) on the web.

A hierarchy of Folder and File objects is created in the CPSArchiveFolder
object using the archive content.

Several details still need to be decided:

- How do you actually navigate through the object (probably through a popup
  windows)

- Default view ?
