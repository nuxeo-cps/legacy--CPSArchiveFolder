CPSArchiveFolder is an object that makes available the content of an archive
(currently ZIP, TGZ might be supported one day in the future) on the web.

Many details need to be completed.

- How do you actually navigate through the object (probably through a popup
  windows)

- Recursive subobject navigation (currently only flat archives are supported)

- Default view ?

- Performances ?

Implementation ideas come from LocalFS.
